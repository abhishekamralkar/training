# Intro to Clojure Training Materials

[Learn more about Brave Clojure On-Site Training](http://www.braveclojure.com/training/)

Hello!

This repo contains all the examples, exercises, and projects we'll be
working on. Every exercise and project you'll be asked to do has an
example solution or implementation. You can look at these before or
during the workshop, or not - whatever helps you learn better.

The [`exercises`](exercises) directory includes all the code and
exercises we'll be looking at during the lectures, as well as
solutions under
[`exercises/src/training/solutions`](exercises/src/training/solutions).

The [`projects`](projects) directory contains example implementations
for the larger projects you'll be working on.

Have fun!

## Keep Learning

One of my goals for this workshop is to provide you with a sturdy
foundation so that you can quickly and easily continue learning on
your own. Here are my recommendations for books, tutorials, and
projects, and other resources:

* [Land of Lisp](http://www.amazon.com/Land-Lisp-Learn-Program-Game/dp/1593272812). This
  is the book that got me started with Lisp. It covers Common Lisp,
  which isn't as immediately practical, but it still helps you
  understand Clojure better. Plus, learning Common Lisp is extremely
  useful because you'll be able to understand other great resources,
  like..
* [On Lisp](http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html). This is one of the
  best books on learning how to think like a Lisp programmer.
* [Clojure Applied](http://www.amazon.com/Clojure-Applied-Practitioner-Ben-Vandgrift/dp/1680500740/)
  is billed as a second book for Clojure, and I think it does a good job.

For projects, my advice is to think of something that you personally
want to build, and try to build it. If you're interested in web
development, [Luminus](http://www.luminusweb.net/) is a good framework
with good documentation.
