# Intro to Clojure Training Materials

Hello!

This repo contains all the examples, exercises, and projects we'll be
working on. Every exercise and project you'll be asked to do has an
example solution or implementation. You can look at these before or
during the workshop, or not - whatever helps you learn better.

The [`exercises`](exercises) directory includes all the code and
exercises we'll be looking at during the lectures, as well as
solutions under
[`exercises/src/training/solutions`](exercises/src/training/solutions).

The [`projects`](projects) directory contains example implementations
for the larger projects you'll be working on.

Have fun!
